# Changelog

## 1.11.1 - 2026-07-19

### Changed

- Split Build execution by provider: Claude retains subagents and isolated worktrees;
  Codex keeps Plan, Implement, and Architect Review inline and delegates fresh-context
  Plan Review and Verify.
- Replaced Codex progress polling with terminal-only supervision, a 20-minute hard
  judgment deadline, and one fresh retry.
- Added typed must-have evidence and exact Approach bindings to new plans. Changed-file
  lists now prove only structural claims; missing or mismatched behavioral evidence is
  `PARTIAL` unless its evidence command fails.

### Migration

Plans without `evidence_mode` are treated as `legacy-untyped`. Unchanged tasks may
continue, but any reopened task must upgrade to typed must-haves and bindings.

## 1.6.2 - 2026-05-17

### Changed

- Updated GitHub repository references to `jameshemson/build`.
- Updated install commands:
  - `claude plugin add jameshemson/build`
  - `codex plugin marketplace add jameshemson/build`

### Migration

Existing installs should update their marketplace source to `jameshemson/build`.
